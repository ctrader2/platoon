# platoon

A terminal app for managing Claude Code sessions (Linux and macOS): every session across every
directory in one list, with status, model, context use and plan usage. Jump into a session, start one,
kill one, and pick sessions back up later.

## Install

```
cargo install --path .
platoon setup
platoon
```

`platoon setup` is a one-time step, and `platoon` won't start until it's done. It shows a checklist of
what it changes in Claude Code's `settings.json`, and running it again is harmless: finished steps show as
already done, and a step whose command points at a platoon that no longer exists is repaired. It backs up
`settings.json` first and leaves everything else in it alone.

| Step | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Status line | Plan usage (5-hour and weekly) and Claude's own context percentage |
| Session guard | Stops two copies of one conversation from overwriting each other |

## Sessions started in platoon keep running

Each one runs under a small background host, so quitting platoon (or closing its terminal) never ends it.
`Ctrl+Space` leaves a session without stopping it.

## See a session live from a regular terminal

```
platoon open            # start a new session in this directory
platoon open a1b2       # join a session by (a prefix of) its id, resuming it if nothing is running
```

The session is shared, tmux-style: every window shows it live and any of them can type. The session is
sized to the smallest window attached. `Ctrl+Space` detaches; the session keeps running. A session running
in a plain `claude` platoon doesn't own can't be shared, so `platoon open` asks before ending it and
reopening the same conversation from its saved history.
